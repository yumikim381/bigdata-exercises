    "\n",
    "A record in a document store is a *document*. Document encoding schemes include XML, YAML, JSON, and BSON, as well as binary forms like PDF and Microsoft Office documents (MS Word, Excel, and so on). MongoDB documents are similar to JSON objects.  Documents are composed of field-value pairs and have the following structure:\n",
    "\n",
    "![123](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/images/crud-annotated-mongodb-insertOne.bakedsvg.svg)\n",
    "\n",
    "The values of fields may include other documents, arrays, and arrays of documents. Data in MongoDB has a flexible schema in the same collection. All documents do not need to have the same set of fields or structure, and common fields in a collection's documents may hold different types of data."

    "4. How does a large number of small documents affect performance? \n",
    "5. What makes document stores different from key-value stores?"

  },
  {
   "cell_type": "markdown",
   "metadata": {},
   "source": [
    "###  Solution\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Flexibility. Not every record needs to store the same properties. New properties can be added on the fly. \n",
    "\n",
    "2. Yes. References can be used for data normalization (check included figure). \n",
    "\n",
    "3. All data for an object is stored in a single record. In general, it provides better performance for read operations (since expensive joins can be omitted), as well as the ability to request and retrieve related data in a single database operation. In addition, embedded data models make it possible to update related data in a single atomic write operation.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. It degrades performance since document stores are basically key-value stores. You should consider *embedding* for performance reasons if you have a collection with a large number of small documents. If you can group these small documents by some logical relationship and you frequently retrieve the documents by this grouping, you might consider \"rolling-up\" the small documents into larger documents that contain an array of embedded documents.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Rolling up these small documents into logical groupings means that queries to retrieve a group of documents involve sequential reads and fewer random disk accesses. Additionally, rolling up documents and moving common fields to the larger document benefits the creation of an index on these fields. There would be fewer copies of the common fields and there would be fewer associated key entries in the corresponding index. See Indexes for more information on indexes.\n",
    "\n",
    "    However, if you often only need to retrieve a subset of the documents within the group, then rolling up the documents may not provide better performance. Furthermore, if small, separate documents represent the natural model for the data, you should maintain that model.\n",
    "    \n",
    "\n",
    "5. Document-oriented databases are inherently a subclass of the key-value store. The difference lies in the way the data is processed: in a key-value store, the data is considered to be inherently opaque to the database, whereas a document-oriented system relies on an internal structure of the documents in order to extract metadata that the database engine uses for further optimization. Although the difference is often mostly in tools of the systems, conceptually the document-store is designed to offer a richer experience with modern programming techniques."

    "\n",
    "3. ```db.restaurants.createIndex({\"address.zipcode\" : 1})```\n",
    "4. No, for a compound multikey index, each indexed document can have at most one indexed field whose value is an array. As such, you cannot create a compound multikey index if more than one to-be-indexed field of a document is an array. \n",
    "5. Just ```db.restaurants.createIndex( \"grades.grade\": 1)```, since ```{\"name\" : 1 , \"address.street\": 1}``` is a projection. Note that in general negation is inefficient \"ne\" queries can use an index, but not very well. They must look at all the index entries other than the one specified by the \"ne\", so they basically have to scan the entire index. Therefore although the total number of objects that are scanned as well their size are reduced, the index is not fully efficient.\n",
    "6.  ```db.restaurants.createIndex({\"grades.score\": 1 , \"grades.grade\": 1 })```  \n",

    "    ```db.restaurants.find({\"grades.score\" : {$gt : 50} }).sort({\"grades.grade\": 1})```, since the resulting \"grades.grade\" from `.find()` operation are not sorted after the filter.\n",
    "7. B covers more cases since MongoDB will use index intersection for queries on two fields. Thus, B includes A. However the compound index is faster than two single-field indexes when you querying for two fields. "
